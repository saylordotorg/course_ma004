**Unit 4: Solving Rational Equations and Their Applications** <span
id="4"></span> 
*This unit will continue with an application of the quadratic equation
called frame problems. You will also be introduced to techniques for
solving rational equations and some relevant applications. For example,
you will study how rational equations can solve work related problems.
As an example, Mary can clean her house in 3 hours. Her teenage daughter
can clean the house in 5 hours. How long will it take to clean the house
if Mary and her daughter work together? You will also learn how rational
equations can be used to solve revenue questions like the following:
you’re planning a community party with your neighbors and the cost will
be $1000. Two of your neighbors back out because of emergencies. The
remaining members had to pay an additional $8. How many neighbors are
involved with the party? Lastly, you will practice using rational
equations to solve distance problems using the formula d = rt, where d
is distance, r is the rate of travel, and t is the time traveled.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 21 hours.

     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which continues the
    discussion of the frame application. While not a picture frame, you
    can consider mowing your yard in a spiral fashion as a similar
    concept. This application is slightly different because it uses a

     Instructions: Read Section 7.7 in Chapter 7 of your textbook, pages
    274–278, to learn techniques to solve rational equations. Rational
    equations are equations that contain rational expressions
    (fractions) with algebraic expressions in the denominator. Note that
    this reading covers the topics in Subunits 4.2.1–4.2.3.  
        
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 2
    hours.

**4.2.1 Rational Equations with No Factoring of the Denominators** <span
id="4.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is also covered by the reading and assessment
assigned in Subunit 4.2.*  

-   **Lecture: YouTube: Tyler Wallace’s Math Lecture Series: “Rational
    Equations – Clear Denominator”**
    Link: YouTube: Tyler Wallace’s Math Lecture Series: [“Rational
    Equations – Clear
    Denominator”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzwgIV4_3I)
    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which discusses solving
    rational equations. The method is identical to solving equations
    with fractions (multiply both sides of the equation by the lowest
    common denominator – LCD) except the denominator has an algebraic
    expression (consists of an unknown).  
        
     You may watch the video as often as you please. You may refer to
    the video when doing the assessment if necessary.  
        
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 30 minutes.

    Equations – Factoring

    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which discusses solving
    rational equations. Again, this is very similar to solving equations
    with fractions. If 4 and 6 were in the denominator, then the LCD is
    12 because 4 = 2<sup>2</sup> and 6 = 2∙3. So you need
    2<sup>2</sup>∙3. If x<sup>2</sup> and x<sup>2</sup> - x were your
    denominators, then the LCD is x<sup>2</sup>(x - 1) because
    x<sup>2</sup> = x∙x and x<sup>2</sup> - x = x(x - 1).  
        
     You may watch the video as often as you please. You may refer to
    the video when doing the assessment if necessary.

    Solutions”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frPQnbpVGN4) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which discusses
    solutions to rational equations. When an equation is multiplied by a
    non-zero number, then the solution set is the same. With rational
    equations, since you are multiplying by an algebraic expression, you
    do not know if you are multiplying by 0 until the unknown variable
    is known. If the expression being multiplied is 0, then you will
    pick up what is known as extraneous solutions. You must always check
    your answer.  
        
     You may watch the video as often as you please. You may refer to
    the video when doing the assessment if necessary.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 9.8 in Chapter 9 of your textbook, pages
    364–369, to learn an application of rational equations and
    quadratics called teamwork. As an example, Mary can clean her house
    in 3 hours. Her teenage daughter can clean the house in 5 hours. How
    long will it take to clean the house if Mary and her daughter work
    together? The solution to this problem is to set up the proper
    rational equation. Suppose you know that when working together it
    takes your two children 4 hours to clean the house and one child
    claims it takes the other child 2 hours longer than the first child
    to clean the house individually. How long will it take each child to
    clean the house? The solution to this problem is to set up a
    rational equation. Multiplying by the lowest common denominator
    (LCD) will result in a quadratic equation to be solved. Note that
    this reading also covers the topics in Subunits 4.3.1–4.3.3.  
        
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 2

     Instructions: Read Section 9.9 in Chapter 9 of your textbook, pages
    370–372, to learn how to solve for a variable if given a product.
    This is another application of the quadratic equation. As an
    example, suppose Julie has a daughter and a son. She tells you that
    the product of their ages is 72. If you subtract 2 from the
    daughter’s age and add 3 to the son’s age and then multiply these
    numbers, the result is 45. What are their ages?

     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which gives an example
    of setting up and solving an equation involving a simultaneous
    product. For instance, suppose the product of two integers = 12 (xy
    = 12); and if you add 3 to the first integer, then the product is 24
    ((x + 3)y = 24). What are the two integers?

**4.5 Distance/Revenue** <span id="4.5"></span> 
-   **Reading: Washington State Board for Community and Technical
    Colleges: Tyler Wallace’s *Beginning Algebra and Intermediate
    Algebra*, 2nd Edition: “Chapter 9, Section 9.10: Application:
    Revenue and Distance”**
    Link: Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges:
    Tyler Wallace’s *Beginning Algebra and Intermediate Algebra*, 2nd
    Edition: [“Chapter 9, Section 9.10: Application: Revenue and
    Distance”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/SAYLOR-MA001-TEXT.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 9.10 in Chapter 9 of your textbook,
    pages 373–379, to learn the distance and revenue applications of
    rational and quadratic equations. The distance applications use the
    formula d = rt, where d is distance, r is the rate of travel, and t
    is the time traveled. This formula leads to some interesting
    applications that result in quadratic equations. As an example, if
    you are planning a trip and know what your average speed will be,
    what happens with the time if you can increase the speed slightly?  
        
     The revenue applications answer questions like the following:
    you’re planning a community party with your neighbors and the cost
    will be $1000. Two of your neighbors back out because of
    emergencies. The remaining members had to pay an additional $8. How
    many neighbors are involved with the party? Note that this reading
    also covers the topics in Subunits 4.5.1–4.5.6.  
        
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 2
    hours.

     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which discusses the
    revenue application of the rational equation. Revenue means revenue
    from a joint venture. The video shows how to set up a problem using
    the formula R = n∙p, where R is revenue, n is the number of
    participants, and p is the price per participant.  
        
     You may watch the video as often as you please. You may refer to
    the video when doing the assessment if necessary.
