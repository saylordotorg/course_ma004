**Unit 2: Simplifying Radical Expressions** <span id="2"></span> 
*Now that you understand linear equations, the next step is to raise the
exponent of the variable from 1 to a fraction. This is called a radical.
This unit will introduce you to radicals and the equivalent form of
radicals – rational exponents. You will learn the arithmetic of
radicals, including rationalizing denominators that contain radicals.
There are many important applications of radicals, such as the
Pythagorean Theorem in geometry, which uses square roots. In addition,
financial calculations of interest rates and current values rely on
rational exponents.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 22.75 hours.

    303–309, to learn how to rationalize denominators. In this section,
    you will learn how to simplify radical expressions with a
    denominator. You first need to simplify all radicals. If no radicals
    are in the denominator, then you can use rules similar to arithmetic
    rules to simplify. If the denominator does have a radical
    expression, then you want to multiply the numerator and the
    denominator by the conjugate of the denominator and then simplify.
    This material also covers Subunits 2.4.1–2.4.5.  
        
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 2
    hours.
