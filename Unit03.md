**Unit 3: Solving Quadratic Equations and Their Applications and
Simplifying Compound Fractions** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, you will study complex numbers and the arithmetic of
complex numbers. Remember from the last unit, you cannot take the square
root of a negative number and get a real number. Instead, you will get
an imaginary number. Now you can study using the radical to solve
equations that contain a power. After that, you will be introduced to
quadratic equations and different techniques used to solve quadratic
equations. Quadratic equations are equations that have x<sup>2</sup> as
an expression. You will also study applications involving quadratic
equations. One of the primary applications is distance above the ground
equation due to gravity. If you throw an object in the air, you know
that the ball will come back to the ground due to gravity. The distance
that the object is above the ground at any time is a quadratic equation.
Solving radical equations and simplifying compound fractions are also
studied.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 30 hours.

     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which discusses solving
    equations involving two radicals. When there are multiple radicals
    in an equation with other terms, solving the equation becomes
    increasingly more complicated because you cannot isolate each
    radical. Even when you raise each side of the equation to a power,
    you will still have a radical on one side. Isolating this radical to
    one side and raising both sides to the power of this index will
    remove the radical.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 9.2 in Chapter 9 of your textbook, pages
    332–336, to learn how to solve equations with exponents using
    radicals. Powers (algebraic expressions with exponents) and radicals
    are opposites, or inverses. This is similar to subtraction being the
    inverse of addition and division being the inverse of
    multiplication. So it is natural to use radicals to solve equations
    with powers. Note that this reading also covers all the topics in
    Subunits 3.3.1–3.3.4.

     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which discusses solving
    equations with even exponents. This case is slightly different than
    odd powers because you need to place a ± in front of the answer. For
    instance, x<sup>2</sup> = 4 then x = ±2. You can check this answer
    by substituting x = +2 for x and then x = -2 for x. You will see
    that both +2 and -2 are solutions.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read section 9.3 in Chapter 9 of your textbook, pages
    337–342, to learn how to solve a quadratic equation by completing
    the square. Quadratic equations are equations with a square term in
    the equation. If there is no linear term, then you can solve the
    equation by using the technique of solving equations with even
    exponents studied in Subunit 3.3.2. If the equation has both a
    linear term and a constant term, there is only one method that works
    for all quadratic equations. This subunit discusses the technique of
    reformulating the equation so that there is a perfect square on one
    side. Then you can use techniques you’ve already learned to solve
    this equation. Note that this reading covers the topics in Subunits
    3.4.1–3.4.3.  
        
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 2

     Instructions: Read Section 9.7 in Chapter 9 of your textbook, pages
    357–363, to learn an application of the quadratic equation:
    rectangles. There are several examples, but basically you know from
    geometry that the area of a rectangle is A = LW where L is the
    length and W is the width of the rectangle. If L and W are related
    (say you know the L of your rectangle is 3 units longer than the W)
    then the A is equal to some quadratic relationship of L or W. If you
    know the area of your rectangle, you now have a quadratic equation
    to determine L or W. Note that this reading covers the topics in
    Subunits 3.6.1–3.6.5.

    perimeter and the formula for the perimeter, P = 2L + 2W, you can
    create a relationship between L and W. As in the previous example,
    you can then create a quadratic equation given the area of the

     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which discusses the
    rectangle and what effects increasing each side have on the area. As
    an example, suppose a square is increased by 6 inches. This results
    in having an area of 16 times the original square. What is the
    dimension of the original square?

     Instructions: Read Section 7.5 in Chapter 7 of your textbook, pages
    262–267, to learn how to simplify and work with compound fractions.
    Compound fractions are fractions in which the numerator is a
    fraction, the denominator is a fraction, or both are fractions. Note
    that this reading also covers the topics in Subunits 3.7.1–3.7.4.  
        
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 2
    hours.

*Note: This subunit is also covered by the reading and assessment
assigned in Subunit 3.7.*

    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which discusses how to
    simplify and handle compound fractions. If you multiply the
    numerator and denominator by the lowest common denominator (LCD) of
    all of the denominators, then you will have a single normal
    fraction.  
        
     You may watch the video as often as you please. You may refer to
    the video when doing the assessment if necessary.

    simplify and work with compound fractions with monomials – single
    algebraic equations – in the denominators.  
        
     You may watch the video as often as you please. You may refer to
    the video when doing the assessment if necessary.

    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which discusses how to
    simplify and work with compound fractions with binomial expressions
    in the denominators of each fraction.

**3.7.4 Compound Fractions with Negative Exponents** <span
id="3.7.4"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is also covered by the reading and assessment
assigned in Subunit 3.7.*

-   **Lecture: YouTube: Tyler “Compound Fractions – Negative
    Exponents”**
    Link: YouTube: Tyler Wallace’s Math Lecture Series: [“Compound
    Fractions – Negative
    Exponents”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzIu6edb1Tc) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which discusses how to
    simplify and work with negative exponents. Recall that a negative
    power is the same as the reciprocal of the expression. So, a
    fraction that has terms with a negative exponent is a compound
    fraction. This video works through an example with negative
    exponents in both the numerator and the denominator.  
        
     You may watch the video as often as you please. You may refer to
    the video when doing the assessment if necessary.  
        
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
