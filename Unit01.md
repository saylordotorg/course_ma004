**Unit 1: Solving Compound Inequalities, Absolute Value Inequalities,
and Systems of Equations** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, you will study how to solve more complicated linear
equations, such as linear equations that include conjunctions and
absolute values. Then, you will study techniques of solving a system of
linear equations. Lastly, applications of all types of linear equations
are presented, such as distance, rate, and time problems; gravitational
pull problems; and other interesting real-world problems.*
