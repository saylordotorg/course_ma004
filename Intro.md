This course is a continuation of [MA001: Beginning
Algebra](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma001/). Algebra allows us to
formulate real-world problems in an abstract mathematical term or
equation. These equations can then be solved by using techniques you
will learn in this course. For example, if I can ride my bicycle at 5
miles per hour and I live 12 miles from work, how long will it take me
to get to work? Or, suppose I am a pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals
and my fast ball is 95 miles per hour, how much time does the hitter
have to react to the baseball? And, can you explain why an object thrown
up into the air will come back down? If so, can you tell how long it
will take for the object to hit the ground? These are all examples of
problems that can be stated as an algebraic equation and then solved. In
this course you will study compound inequalities and solve systems of
linear equations. You will then study radicals and rational exponents,
followed by quadratic equations and techniques used to solve these
equations. Finally, you will study general functions and graphs with an
emphasis on the exponential and logarithmic functions. You will apply
these skills to solve real-world problems, represented as word problems.
Each unit will have its own application problems, based on the concepts
to which you have been exposed in the unit. This course is also intended
to provide you with a strong foundation for Calculus I.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   solve compound inequalities, absolute value inequalities, and
    systems of linear equations;

-   solve quadratic equations and applications, and also simplify
    compound fractions;
-   solve rational equations and applications;
-   use function notation to model real-world problems; and

### Course Information

Welcome to MA004: Intermediate Algebra. General information about this
course and its requirements can be found below.  
    
 **Course Designer: **Dr. Jim Vandergriff  
    
 **Primary Resources: **This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges: Tyler
    Wallace’s *[Beginning Algebra and Intermediate Algebra,
    2<sup>nd</sup>
    Edition](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/SAYLOR-MA001-TEXT.pdf)*
    (PDF);
-   Big Bend Community College: Tyler Wallace’s *[Intermediate Algebra
    Lab
    Notebook](http://www.wallace.ccfaculty.org/book/MPC%20099%20Workbook.pdf) *(PDF);
    and
-   YouTube: Tyler Wallace’s [Math Lecture
    Series](http://www.youtube.com/user/wallacemath/videos?view=1)
    (YouTube).

This course has been developed through a partnership with the Washington
State Board for Community and Technical Colleges. Unless otherwise
noted, all materials are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution
3.0 Unported License. The Saylor Foundation has modified some materials
created by the Washington State Board for Community and Technical
Colleges in order to best serve our users.  
    
 **Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Remember that mathematics is like a set of building blocks, meaning each
unit should be mastered before continuing to the next unit. You will
also need to complete the unit assessments and final exam.  
    
 Please note that you will only receive an official grade on your final
exam. However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will
need to work through the problem sets within the above-listed
assessments.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment: **Completing this course should take a total of
approximately **129.25 hours.** Each unit includes a time advisory that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. It
may be useful to take a look at these time advisories, determine how
much time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and
then set goals for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take
approximately 28 hours. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and
decide to complete Subunit 1.1 (estimated at 4.5 hours) on Monday night;
Subunit 1.2 (estimated at 4.5 hours) on Tuesday night; Subunit 1.3
(estimated at 5 hours) on Wednesday night; etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions: **As noted in the “Course Requirements,” there are
prerequisites for this course. It may be helpful to review [MA001:
Beginning Algebra](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma001/) before you
begin this course.
