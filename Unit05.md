**Unit 5: Functions** <span id="5"></span> 
*This unit will introduce you to functions in general, operations on
functions, and inverse functions. This is a very important unit
especially for students that will be continuing to calculus. You will
also learn about two very important functions: the exponential function
and its inverse, the logarithmic function. You will also study various
applications of these functions. The exponential function has many
applications. One of the most common applications is to calculate
compound interest.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 27.5 hours.

assigned in Subunit 5.1.*

    Link: YouTube: Tyler Wallace’s Math Lecture Series: [“Functions –
    Definition and Vertical Line
    Test”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkFMvqwbVb0) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which discusses the
    definition of a function as well as the vertical line test.
    Functions are relations between two variables (in general denoted by
    x and y, where x is the independent variable and y is the dependent
    variable) such that for each value of x there is only one value of
    y. If a relationship between x and y is graphed, one can determine
    if the relationship is a function by using the vertical line test.
    The graph represents a function if every vertical line intersects
    the graph at most once.  
        
     You may watch the video as often as you please. You may refer to
    the video when doing the assessment if necessary.  
        
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

    Domain”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5ahgB8p7i4) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which explains the
    notion of the domain of a function. The domain of this function
    contains all values that can replace x such that you can calculate
    y. Speaking geometrically, this means all values of x such that a
    vertical line through x will intersect the graph.  
        
     You may watch the video as often as you please. You may refer to

     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which discusses
    function notation. The explicit function notation is f(x), so you
    write y = f(x), which means y is a function of x. This is a
    convenient notation to explicitly define a function and evaluate.
    For instance, to write y = f(3) means “what is y when x = 3?”

     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which discusses
    evaluating a function at an algebraic expression. In the last video,
    you saw how to evaluate at a number, say f(3) for instance. Using
    the same concept, you can evaluate at an algebraic expression, for
    instance f(x+3).  
        
     You may watch the video as often as you please. You may refer to

    where the graph stops going down and starts going up or vice versa),
    a line of symmetry, and a maximum value or a minimum value. Note
    that this reading covers the topics in Subunits 5.4.1 and 5.4.2.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 10.6 in Chapter 10 of your textbook,
    pages 414–419, to learn an application of the exponential functions,
    namely compound interest. A bank has certificates of deposits (CDs)
    for sale. The interest rate paid is determined by the length of time
    that the consumer chooses. The bank will compound the interest
    (calculate the interest, and then pay interest on this interest)
    during various intervals of time (quarterly, monthly, annually).
    Once all of these parameters are known, the compound formula
    calculates the return on your CD. Note that this reading also covers
    the topics in Subunits 5.6.1–5.6.4.  
        
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 2
    hours.

     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which discusses an
    application of the exponential function, namely continuous

    Functions”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/SAYLOR-MA001-TEXT.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 10.5 in Chapter 10 of your textbook,
    pages 410–413, to learn about logarithmic functions. The logarithmic
    functions are the inverse functions to the exponential. Thus, these
    functions become important when needing to solve an exponential
    equation with the unknown in the exponent. Logarithmic functions
    have many real-world applications. When the magnitude of an
    earthquake is reported, the report does not give the actual tremor,
    since this is a very large number. The report gives the log of the
    tremor. The same is true for reporting sound (decibels) and acidity
    (ph). Note that this reading also covers the topics in Subunits
    5.7.1–5.7.3.  
        
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 2
    hours.

     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which discusses how to
    convert from a logarithmic expression (log) to an exponential
    expression and vice versa. The conversion formula is: b<sup>x</sup>
    = a is equivalent to log<sub>b</sub>a = x.  
        
     You may watch the video as often as you please. You may refer to

     Instructions: Watch the video linked above, which discusses
    evaluating logarithmic expressions. For general bases (bases other
    than 10 and e which are on all scientific calculators), determining
    the value of a log may be easier to convert to an exponential
    expression. Then you can use previous learned techniques to solve
    the exponential equation. Thus, convert log<sub>b</sub>a = x to
    b<sup>x</sup> = a. Then use the techniques you learned in Subunit
    5.5.
